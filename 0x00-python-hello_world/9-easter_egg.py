zen_of_python = """The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dence.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Error should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and prefered only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is always better than *right* now.
If the implimentation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implimentation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"""
